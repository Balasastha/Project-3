ðŸš€ Successfully designed and deployed a Kubernetes-based CI/CD pipeline for a Healthcare Domain project, ensuring automation, scalability, and real-time monitoring.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:

âœ… AWS Infrastructure Setup: Provisioned EC2 instances using Terraform for automated infrastructure deployment.

âœ… CI/CD Pipeline Implementation: Configured Jenkins for automated builds and integrated GitHub 
âœ… Webhooks for continuous deployment.

âœ… Containerized Deployment: Used Docker and Kubernetes (K8s) for seamless microservices deployment.

âœ…Infrastructure Automation: Implemented Ansible for automated configuration management.

âœ… Real-time Monitoring: Deployed Prometheus & Grafana to track system health, CPU usage, and disk space utilization.

ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack & Tools Used:
âœ… Version Control & CI/CD: Git, GitHub, Jenkins
âœ… Cloud Platform: AWS (EC2, IAM, Security Groups)
âœ… Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform
âœ… Containerization & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes (K8s)
âœ… Automation & Configuration Management: Ansible
âœ… Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter
âœ… Security & Access Management: GitHub PAT, AWS IAM
âœ… Programming & Scripting: Shell Scripting, YAML

This project helped me gain expertise in DevOps, Kubernetes, cloud automation, and CI/CD pipelines. Excited to take on more cloud-native and DevOps engineering challenges! ðŸš€
